              I have been pondering about the energy that flows through our the universe and throughout our bodies. The atoms that make up our tissues, eyes, hands, bodies, and the rest of the whole. 
              Matter that by exchanging electrons with one another; destroy existing matter and create new matter. There is no denying we live in a unique and beautiful universe.
              What is this place and what does it all hold?. What's beyond atoms? What make up atoms and why did we even get atoms? Why didn't we get something else?
            </p>
            <p>
              Pondering about these questions brings a uncomfortable feeling of euphoria, but why? Why does considering the very nature of my body and my world around me, sends the body spiriling into anxiety?
